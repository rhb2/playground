Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings

1. Algorithm to determine whether or not a string consists of entirely unique
   characters.

2. Given two strings, check to see if one is a permutation of the other.

3. Given a string, replace all spaces in it with '%20' (URLify).

4. Given a string, write a function to determine if it is a permutation of a
   palindrome.

5. Given two strings, write a function to determine if they are exactly one
   edit away from each other, where an edit can be an addition of a single
   character, the removal of one, or a modification of one (and only one).

6. Write a function to compress a string, replacing all duplicates of a given
   character with the number of times it occurs consecutively and then a single
   instance of the character instead.  If the compressed string is longer than
   the original, then just return the original.

7. Given an NxN matrix, write a function that rotates the entire thing by
   90 degrees.

8. Write a function such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire
   row and column are set to 0.

9. Write a function to determine if one string is a rotation of another.
   Example "waterbottle" and "erbottlewat".
