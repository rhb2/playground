This problem was not actually one that involves coding.  The question:

Explain what the following does: ((n & (n - 1)) == 0)

Answer: It's simple.  It evaluates to true if `n' is a power of two.  For
example, let `n' be equal to 8:

8     = 1000
8 - 1 = 0111

`n & (n - 1)` would evaluate to `(1000 & 0111)` which in turn would evaluate
to `0`.  Going back to the original expression above, we would then have:

`(1000 & 0111) == 0` which evaluates to true.
