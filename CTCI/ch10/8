Question:

You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to N, where N is at most 32,000.
The array may have duplicate entries and you do not know what N is.  With only
4 kilobytes of memory available, how would you print all duplicate elements in
the array?

Answer:

Create a bit vector of 32,000 bits.  Each bit represents 1 integer.  Scan the
array and set bits at the index equal to the value that you see.  Check the
value of the bit prior to setting it.  If it is already 1, then we just saw
a duplicate value.
